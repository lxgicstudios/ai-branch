## Requirements

No install needed. Just run with npx. Node.js 18+ recommended. Requires OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
npx ai-branch --help
```

## How It Works

Takes your description and determines the appropriate branch type (feature, fix, chore, etc.). Extracts key terms and creates a concise, readable branch name following conventional naming patterns. Can optionally run git checkout -b for you.

## License

MIT. Free forever. Use it however you want.
